# ibkr-executor — the IBKR execution service

ALL automated trading through Interactive Brokers routes through this one
service. Strategy engines stay keyless and emit decisions; this service
holds the IBKR connection and executes them — same separation of powers as
btc-executor (Coinbase) enforces for the BTC book.

## Architecture

```
strategy managers (keyless decision brains)     ibkr-executor
  app/manager.py  El Nino options ladder   -->  IB Gateway (containerized,
  <future>        next IBKR strategies          ib_async) -> IBKR
```

- Each strategy is a state machine emitting ORDER INTENTS
  ({OPEN|CLOSE, structure, budget, reason}); the execution layer prices,
  places (combo orders for spreads), and reports fills back.
- Safety doctrine (inherited from btc-executor): DRY_RUN default, paper
  account first, per-strategy budgets and kill switches, Telegram alerts
  on every action, persisted state, /status surface.

## Strategies

| module | book | status |
|---|---|---|
| manager.py (El Nino ladder) | NG call spread -> SB put spread -> SLV call spread, triggered + sequential, house-money rolling (see elnino-lab/ELNINO.md) | infra deployed OFFLINE; combo placement lands with paper phase; live target Nov 2026 window |

## Service modes (auto-selected at boot)

| mode | condition | behavior |
|---|---|---|
| OFFLINE | no TWS credentials | full decision loop, DryAdapter, no gateway |
| DRY | credentials present, DRY_RUN=true | gateway boots; mutations still simulated |
| PAPER | TRADING_MODE=paper, DRY_RUN=false | real combo orders on the paper account |
| LIVE | TRADING_MODE=live, DRY_RUN=false | real money (Nov gate, per-leg cutover) |

Control surface: `/health` (public), `/status`, `/kill` (closes all open
legs, halts), `/resume` — token-gated via `X-Exec-Token` header or
`?token=`, same pattern as btc-executor.

## Rollout gates

1. IB adapter vs IBKR PAPER account (free simulated twin, real market data)
2. Paper rehearsal through at least one full trigger cycle
3. Live cutover per leg, DRY_RUN flip discipline

## Account prerequisites (one-time, in IBKR settings)

- Trading permissions: futures, futures options, option spreads
- Paper trading account activated
- October decision: Secure Login System opt-out for the API user
  (headless login; also restricts withdrawals - security win)
